        Welcome to the Essentials Lite Forum!
        This is the Essentials Lite forum page. Here you can ask all of your burning questions to our staff and community.
        <h2>Forum Rules</h2>
        <h3>
          Do Your Research
        </h3>
        <p>
          We expect you to be familiar with the commands at your disposal through Minecraft, and Essentials Lite. Posts that
          ask questions like "how to I use this command", or questions that have answers on the home page will be deleted.
          You should also make sure to browse the forum for posts that already answer your question before you post. Storage 
          ins't free.
        </p>
        <h3>Love thy neighbor as thyself</h3>
        <p>
          Don't be rude to us (we're sensitive) or others. If someone asks a question that seems obvious to you, or even one
          that breaks these rules, we expect you to be kind and considerate of these individuals.
        </p>
        <h3>Be Specific</h3>
        <p>
          If you have a problem, provide as much information about the events surrounding the issue as possible. Things like the
          crash logs, if server logs, server info and so on are very important information when troubleshooting these kinds of
          things.
        </p>
        <h3>Keep feature suggestions to a minimum</h3>
        <p>
          We're okay with you suggesting features, but keep in mind this is a lite plugin. Think to yourself "does my server Need
          this?" if the answer is no or even maybe, don't suggest it. Also make sure you get feedback from others before posting,
          "Will other people use this feature?"
        </p>
