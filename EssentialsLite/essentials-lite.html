           <h2>What Is Essentials Lite?</h2>
           <p>
             Essentials Lite is a lite version of the popular essentials plugin. We didn't
             like many of the features of of essentials and its newer equivalents, so we
             made our own!
           </p>
           <h2>What's different?</h2>
           <p>
             Commands like the /give command, the /enchant command and the /kittycannon
             command have been left out. /give and /enchant were unnecessary because
             Minecraft already has versions of these that are better. Commands like /kittycannon
             were left out because they aren't necessary. For a more complete documentation
             of comands see the documentation on the Essentials Lite Git Hub page.
           </p>
           <h2>Commited to Effeciency</h2>
           <p>
             We aren't perfect, but our team is commited to making this plugin as fast and as
             memory effiecient as possible. We acknowledge that people looking for a lite version
             of a plugin are often concerned about how much of the resources available to them
             are being used. To help with this, features that write to your server's directory can
             be turned off in the config file (see documentation on Git Hub).
           </p>
           <h2>In Progress</h2>
           <p>
             We're proud of the work we've done so far, but we still have a lot to do. Our team is 
             hard at work implementing as many of the truly essential features that will take your 
             Minecraft Server's community to the next level. Want to see what these features are?
             Find us on Git Hub and go to our projects page. We keep thorough documentation of the
             things we're working on and that we plan to work on.
